Work Experience
Data Scientist @ Toyota Financial Services (June 2022 - Present)
Uncovered and corrected a missing step in the production data pipeline, impacting over 70% of active accounts.   
Redeveloped the loan originations model, resulting in a 50% improvement in model performance and saving $1 million in potential losses.
Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (December 2020 - Present)
Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for a novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios.   
Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes.
Projects
Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
Developed an objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using Python. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed commonly used methods. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and potentially discovering new indices of brain activity.   

EEG Band Discovery: Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
Used Matlab to train over 100 machine learning models that estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. The project found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales (r^2 = 0.91) with smaller particles being better estimated. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows for disentangling key interactions between the environment and the body.
